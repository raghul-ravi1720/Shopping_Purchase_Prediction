# Shopping_Purchase_Prediction

### Description:
This project aims to predict whether an online shopper will generate revenue or not based on various features such as administrative activities, duration spent on different pages, bounce rates, exit rates, and more. The dataset used for this project is the "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset" which contains information about online sessions and whether they resulted in a purchase or not.

### Files Included:

1. online_shoppers_intention.csv: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the predictive model.
2. online_shoppers_intention.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
3. README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to run the code.
